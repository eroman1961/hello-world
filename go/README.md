# hello-world
My very first repo just to familiarize myself with the functionality of GH

## Go

Build:
```bash
go build -o hello
```

Run:
```bash
go run main.go
# or run the built binary
./hello
```

## About `main.go`

`main.go` (in this folder) is a minimal Go program that prints `Hello, world!` to standard output. Use the examples above to build or run it.

From the `go` folder:

```bash
go run main.go
```

Or from the repository root:

```bash
go run ./go
```

Expected output:

```
Hello, world!
```

This addition documents the program behavior and quick run instructions.
